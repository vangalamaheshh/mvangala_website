<div id="text">
<p>Hello, I am Mahesh Vangala. A bioinformatician by profession, a programmer by hobby and a runner by choice. I try to share my coding stories, running experiences and little bit of everything that I find amusing in life on my blog. Do check my blog regularly!</p>
<p><h3>... as a Bioinformatician</h3>
I am currently working as NGS-data analyst at Dana-Farber, Boston, MA. I kicked tires with almost all areas of Bioinformatics in my 6+ years in the field. Areas I worked on include, Metagenomics, RNA-Seq, Chip-Seq, CRISPR analysis, Antibody-ome studies, to name a few. Please check <b>Projects page</b> to read more on this.</p>  
<p><h3>... as a Programmer</h3>
I code mostly in Perl, Python, Ruby and Bash. Even though, I love Java, Bioinformatics won't let you do much with it. I am fascinated by latest technologies such as Docker and keep myself busy learning these nifty tools in my free time. Check my <a href="https://github.com/vangalamaheshh" target="_blank">github</a> page.
<p><h3>... as a Runner</h3>
I like racing half marathons. I think it's perfect distance to enjoy with out beating yourself up too much. My ambition is to finish 50 States Half one day!</p>
